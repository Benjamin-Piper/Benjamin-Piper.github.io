This blog is for my thoughts, so I'll be stating my opinion a lot.
I will do my very best to make this as explicit as possible, i.e., you will see
frequent use of ‘I’ and ‘my’. I am constantly growing and learning so I want to
encourage scepticism in these posts. Here's a clip of Bill Burr:

And for those that can't watch:

{% blockquote(author="Bill Burr") %}
The library has the decency to break up information between non-fiction and
fiction ... you go on the internet, everything is presented as non-fiction ...
{% end %}

The _last_ thing I want is the public misconstruing my subjective viewpoint as
facts.

When I do make factual statements, I'll endeavour to back them up with citations.
I've made the decision to not use comments on this blog so please ignore such
statements if I've failed to do this.

I also think it's worth mentioning that I'm trying to stop myself from saying
things like ‘I am [adjective]’ or ‘I am a [noun]’. This is because I don't want
to limit myself with labels. I believe the only label anyone deserves is
individual. We are all individuals. What we do as individuals may differ but I 
don't believe that defines who we are.
