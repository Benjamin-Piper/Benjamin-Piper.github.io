Here I introduce Morphs: a new way (as far as I can tell) to use emojis. And I
encourage everyone to try them out!

## What is a Morph?

A Morph is one or more emojis used to conjure imagery of an observed appearance
and/or behaviour of something.

Take the following sentence:

> We were all standing up at the concert, but it was easy for me to see over the
> crowd.

So the speaker and many people were standing up, yet the speaker was still able
to see? Without any further information, they must be either in an elevated
position or significantly taller than the average person there...

Now, let's add a Morph!

> We were all standing up at the concert, but it was easy for me to see over the
> crowd 🦕

Whoa. Okay 😅 The imagery of a sauropod doesn't clarify where the speaker is,
but it's cool IMO to imagine how high up the speaker's head must be!

## Imagery of the observed

The intention behind Morphs is to conjure imagery that is observed. We already
use emojis for symbolic meaning, so let's try something new!
Instead of using...

- 🕊️ to represent peace
- 🦁 to represent bravery
- 🐞 to represent luck

Why not try use them like so?

{% details(summary="Follow me, everyone! This is the way back home 🕊️") %}
From Wikipedia: Homing pigeons, a domesticated form of rock doves, have been
bred for their homing ability.
{% end %}

{% details(summary="You know how I feel about family 🦁") %}
From Wikipedia: Lions live in prides.
{% end %}

{% details(summary="Let's take care of those bugs 🐞") %}
From Wikipedia: Ladybugs prey on agricultural pests such as aphids and scale
insects.
{% end %}

A morph may use more than one emoji as well!

> I _guess_ you could say the two of us are similar 🦕🦒

This may take some research to find out observed appearance and behaviour. To
learn more about animals, I recommend
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page),
[True Facts by Ze Frank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyJVMhOpkk&list=PLOHbM4GGWADc5bZgvbivvttAuWGow6h05),

## Any emoji is fair game

I've just been using animals so far because that's what I'm currently interested
in.

Any emoji may be used for Morphs. Any emoji is fair game.

Extinct animals like the dinosaurs and the dodo are fair game.

Fictional things like unicorns, dragons, and zombies are fair game. Do note for
some of these (e.g., dragons) their observed appearance and/or behaviour may
culturally differ.

Food, places, you name it. Any emoji is fair game.

## Qualities of Morphs

Morphs encourage curiosity. Research may be needed to find out observed
appearance and behaviour.

Morphs tend to be more universal. Some things are not found everywhere, but
their observed appearance and behaviour remains accessible! People can learn
about kangaroos and their behaviours without needing to live in Australia or
understand the cultural contexts in which kangaroos have acquired symbolic
meaning.

Morphs are expressive. Only emojis, rather than words, are needed to conjure
imagery. I'm excited to see Morphs used in literary art!

## Go have fun!

Morphs are a new way (as far as I can tell) to use emojis. Emojis are free. Why
not give it a try?
