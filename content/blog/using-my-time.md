I currently live in a mainly monochronic culture. Online and off, I see and
hear many variants of the same attitude:

> Time doesn't last forever, it is precious. Don't waste your time.

I dub this attitude ‘OptiTime’, and I no longer fully subscribe to it.

We are currently mortal, so I subscribe to the idea that ‘_our_ time doesn't
last forever’, but, ignoring
[relativity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-time-tick-at-the-same-rate-for-everyone/),
I don't subscribe to the ideas that ‘time is precious’ and
‘time can be wasted’.

Since wasting is a form of usage, I think it's important to explore the usage
of time before we dive deeper into my opinions.

## Exploring Time Usage

Let's gather some information:

- Who is using time? Everyone.
- On What is time used? Activities.
- Where is time used? Everywhere.
- When is time used? Always.
- Why is time used? There's no alternative.
- How is time used? By choosing who with, what on, and where.

Out of all my terse answers, the only subjective one answers the ‘how’.
‘Who with’, ‘what on’, and ‘where’ are also choices we have at least some
control over.

These choices all relate to activities. How time is used for activites will be
my standard to criticise OptiTime.

## Criticising OptiTime

OptiTime motivated me to organise. I filtered my desires (what I want to do)
and obligations (what I ought to do) into a shortlist of goals. These goals
determined what activities I engaged in. And the activities structured my days.

Unfortunately these goals had to contend with reality. I've concluded that if
one believes ‘time can be wasted’, then it inevitably will be.

Of course how we use our time is subjective, therefore how we waste it is also.
When I upheld OptiTime, I defined a waste of time to be:

> Any activity that ends up not mattering/goes to no purpose, and/or goes over
an acceptable amount of time. 

With the former criterion, sometimes a lot of time is used on an activity to
try but fail to do something. How many times have you heard ‘so that whole
thing was a waste of time’? 

I'd like to underscore how often the latter criterion is satisfied, so much so,
that we have Hofstadter's Law:

> It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account
Hofstadter's Law.

Each time I wasted my time I've felt regret. ‘I shouldn't have done that...I
should have...’ Each time I felt regret I would agonise how I wasted time and
whether I'm wasting time right now. Each time this happened I suffered.

## Adopting EntiTime

I decided last year that I don't want that anymore.

So I've adopted a new attitude, I dub this one ‘EntiTime’:

> _My_ time can neither be wasted nor well-spent.

Emphasis on ‘my’, I still live in a mainly monochronic culture, and so I
still wish to respect other's temporal boundaries.

Ever since adopting EntiTime, I've noticed an increase in gratitude within me.

I transform the ‘should haves’ into ‘next times’. The regret of wasting time
becomes a reminder that's filed away for the future.

I no longer get [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out).
Every moment is an opportunity cost. Every moment is a new experience. Every
moment hides a lesson.

This all serves to bring me into the present :)

In the present I have my preferences for activities, but the day is not ruined if they don't happen.

## In Summary

I have adopted EntiTime as it better reflects my perspective on life. 

Reader, you may actually still wish to believe that _your_ time can be wasted.
If you are not highly open to experience and only care deeply about a few
things, then OptiTime is absolutely a good attitude. It will help you deter
distractions and optimise for your objectives.
